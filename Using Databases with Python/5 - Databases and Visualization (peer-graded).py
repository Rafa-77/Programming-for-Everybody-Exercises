# Download the code from http://www.py4e.com/code3/geodata.zip -
# then unzip the file and edit where.data to add an address nearby where you live - don't reveal where you live.
# Then run the geoload.py to lookup all of the entries in where.data (including the new one) and produce the geodata.sqlite.
# Then run geodump.py to read the database and produce where.js.
# You can run the programs and then scroll back to take your screen shots when the program finishes.
# Then open where.html to visualize the map. Take screen shots as described below.
# Make sure that your added location shows in all three of your screen shots.
