# Mailing List Data - Part II
# In this assignment you will visualize the mailing list data you have downloaded from http://mbox.dr-chuck.net/
# and take some screen shots.

# Important:
# You do not have to download all of the data.
# Do not use low counts like 1, 20, 100, 300.
# You can run gmane multiple times to download more messages.
# It is completely acceptable to visualize a small subset of the data in the gbasic screenshot.
# For the gbasic screenshot show the lines for dump?, loaded messages=,
# and both sections for Top Email list participants & Email list organizations.


# Please Upload Your Submission:

# A screen shot of you running the gbasic.py program to compute basic histogram data on the messages you have retrieved.


# A screen shot of word cloud visualization for the messages you have retrieved.


# A screen shot of time line visualization for the messages you have retrieved showing messages per month.


# Optional Challenge: Change the gline.py program to show the message count by year instead of by month
# and take a screen shot of the by year visualization.
# You can switch from a by-month to a by-year visualization by changing only a few lines in gline.py.
# The puzzle is to figure out the smallest change to accomplish the change.
# If you do not want to do this optional challenge - just upload the above image a second time.
